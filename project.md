**Yield Arena**

**_Welcome to the Yield Arena._**

**_Vault Managers battle with strategy._**

**_Users stake with conviction._**

**_The best vault wins it all._**

**_Every yield is a trophy._**

**_Every epoch is a war._**

**_No-loss competition. Real performance. On-chain glory._**

**Overview**

Yield Arena is a competitive DeFi platform where users stake capital into competing “Battle Vaults” managed by different Portfolio Managers (Porto Managers).

Each vault runs for a fixed duration (e.g. 2 weeks or 1 month).

At the end of each epoch:

- The vault with the highest yield performance (based on ROI %) wins.
- All other vaults’ yield (not principal) is redistributed to the winning vault’s stakers.
- The winning manager earns prestige and performance fees.
- If a vault’s portfolio drops by 10% or more, it is automatically disqualified (cannot win that epoch).

Yield Arena creates an esports-like meta-layer for DeFi — a gamified marketplace of fund performance and user conviction.

**Mechanics Flow**

User Flow

Stake Phase

- Users browse active “Arenas” (e.g. “ETH Yield Arena – November”).
- Each arena lists competing vaults, their managers, strategies, and risk profiles.
- Users stake funds (e.g. stablecoins, ETH, etc.) into a chosen vault.

Lock Phase

- Once the Arena begins, deposits are locked.
- Managers deploy capital according to their strategy (can integrate yield farms, RWA protocols, etc.).
- The platform tracks performance metrics in real time.

Battle Phase

- Vault performance updates daily (TVL, yield %).
- Public leaderboard visible to all users.
- Vault auto-DQ triggers if loss ≥10%.

Resolution Phase

At end of epoch:

- Compare vault ROI% (excluding fees).
- Identify top-performing vault.

Collect all yield from losing vaults and distribute:

- 75% → Winning vault stakers (pro-rata)
- 10% -> All vault managers (based on vault performance)
- 10% → Winning vault manager (performance fee)
- 5% → Protocol treasury

Withdrawal Phase

- Users can withdraw **principal + yield (if in winning vault).**
- Losing vault users get **principal only**.

**UI like battle-royale, each epoch will shows return**

**Arena Commentary: AI commentator summarizes daily performance:**

**“The Banker remains composed with steady gains, but The Scientist’s volatility spikes to 9.3% — one wrong trade could trigger DQ.”**

**Spectator Commentary**

**Roadmap**

In the future, we’re going to partner and collab with professional vault manager

Drift Earn basically smart contractnya langsung kerja jadi liquidity buat trader di Drift no manual touch. Sama kayak vault di DeFi (kayak Yearn, Beefy, Kamino), semua strategi sudah discript di smart contract, auto stake, harvest, compound semuanya jalan sendiri. Kadang cuma ada tim atau governance yang tweak param dikit doang. Intinya Drift Earn & DeFi vault tuh mostly udah on-chain automated, bukan manual play dari “vault manager”
